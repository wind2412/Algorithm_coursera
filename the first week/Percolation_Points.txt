Testing methods in Percolation
*-----------------------------------------------------------
Running 15 total tests.

Tests 1 through 8 create a Percolation object using your code, then repeatedly
open sites by calling open(). After each call to open(), we check the return
values of isOpen(i, j) for every (i, j), the return value of percolates(),
and the return value of isFull(i, j) for every (i, j), in that order.

Except as noted, a site is opened at most once.

         (to make sure you didn't store data in static variables)
==> passed

Test 12: Open predetermined list of sites using file inputs,
         but change the order in which methods are called

Running time in seconds depends on the machine on which the script runs,
and  varies each time that you submit. If one of the values in the table
violates the performance limits, the factor by which you failed the test
appears in parentheses. For example, (9.6x) in the union() column
indicates that it uses 9.6x too many calls.


Tests 2a-2d: Check whether number of calls to union(), connected(), and find()
             is a constant per call to open(), isFull(), and percolates().

             find() calls made during a single call to open(), isFull(), and
