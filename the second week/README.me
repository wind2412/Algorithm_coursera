Something I must say is that I get the perfect random method from CSDN blog. Web site: http://blog.csdn.net/u013685323/article/details/25719329
Because at first time I use linked-list to implement the RandomizedQueue, too. And the score is only 50+... It is fortunate to me to find a person has the
same experience. Then I got the 100 mark. In all, this homework is not so hard. Besides, I will paster my linked-list implementation on my Github, too.
As a commemorate.
